          <p> Hi, I'm Waldir!</p>
          <p>
            I am a self-taught developer and passionate about technology, I am
            currently a frontend developer, of course I am going for more. I can
            develop responsive websites and apps from scratch and turn them into
            modern, easy-to-use web experiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have helped several clients establish their online presence and
            provide solutions. I always strive to learn about the latest
            technologies and frameworks.
